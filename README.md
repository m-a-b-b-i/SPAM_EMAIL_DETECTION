Spam Email Detection
This project implements a spam email detection system using Python, numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn. It builds a classification model to classify emails as "spam" or "not spam" using a dataset of labeled emails.

Usage
Download the Dataset: Download a dataset like the SMS Spam Collection dataset and save it as spam.csv in the data/ folder.

Run the Project: After setting up the project, you can run the main script to train the model and classify a sample email.

python main.py
This will:
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Train a Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam emails.
Display the accuracy of the model.
Classify a sample email as either "Spam" or "Not Spam."

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains labeled emails classified as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). You can use any dataset with similar structure, but the SMS Spam Collection dataset is recommended for this project.

Dataset Columns:
v1: Label (ham or spam)
v2: The email text (message)
Model
This project uses the Naive Bayes classifier from scikit-learn for email classification. The model is trained using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.

Steps in Model Training:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned by selecting the relevant columns and converting labels to binary values (0 for "ham" and 1 for "spam").
Feature Extraction: The text messages are vectorized into numerical features using the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn.
Model Training: A Multinomial Naive Bayes model is trained on the vectorized data.
Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the trained model is evaluated using the test set.
